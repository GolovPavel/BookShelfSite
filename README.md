## How to configure project?
First, you should create virtual environment and download all packages from 'requirements.txt' file.

Next, you should create 'book_shelf/secret_data.py' file and create the next constants:
1. SECRET_KEY

Next, you should create 'book_shelf/book_shelf/db.cnf' file and configure db settings (the project uses MySQL db).
